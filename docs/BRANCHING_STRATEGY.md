# 🌿 Git Branching Strategy for Team

## Visual Workflow

```
main (production-ready)
├── feature/user-authentication    (Person 1)
├── feature/skills-assessment     (Person 2)  
├── feature/job-recommendations   (Person 3)
└── fix/urgent-bug               (Hotfix)

After development:
main ← merge ← feature/user-authentication
main ← merge ← feature/skills-assessment  
main ← merge ← feature/job-recommendations
```

## Daily Team Workflow

### 🌅 Morning (Everyone)
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/today-task-name
```

### 💻 During Development
```bash
# Work on your feature...
git add .
git commit -m "feat: describe what you did"
git push -u origin feature/today-task-name
```

### 🌙 Evening
```bash
git push  # Make sure work is saved
# Create Pull Request if feature is complete
```

## Branch Naming Examples

```bash
# Features
feature/user-login-ui
feature/skills-assessment-ui
feature/django-user-api
feature/job-recommendation-algorithm

# Bug Fixes
fix/login-validation-error
fix/component-styling-issue
fix/docker-compose-networking

# Hotfixes (urgent)
hotfix/security-patch
hotfix/database-connection
```

## Who Works Where

| Developer | Primary Focus | Directories |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| **Frontend Dev** | UI/UX, SaaS Platform | `frontend/src/` |
| **Backend Dev** | API, Database | `backend/` |
| **Full-Stack** | Integration | Both + `devops/` |

## Merge Strategy

### Option 1: Pull Requests (Recommended)
1. Push feature branch
2. Create PR on GitHub
3. Team reviews code
4. Merge after approval
5. Delete feature branch

### Option 2: Direct Merge (Advanced)
1. Communicate with team first
2. Test locally
3. Merge to main
4. Push immediately

## Conflict Resolution

```bash
# When conflicts happen:
git pull origin main          # Get latest changes
# Fix conflicts in files (look for <<<< ==== >>>>)
git add .                     # Mark as resolved
git commit -m "resolve: merge conflicts"
git push
```

## Emergency Commands

```bash
# Save work quickly
git stash

# Get back to safe state
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Start fresh
git checkout -b feature/new-approach

# Restore saved work
git stash pop
```

## Team Communication

- 📢 Announce what you're working on
- 🚨 Report blockers immediately  
- 🤝 Help teammates with conflicts
- 📝 Write clear commit messages
- 🔍 Review code thoughtfully

Remember: **Better to ask than break something!** 🛡️
