# Updated Global Score Calculation Formula

## ✅ New Comprehensive Scoring System

The global score now includes **6 components** instead of the previous 4:

### Score Components & Weights:

1. **Skills Match** - **40%** (was 50%)
   - Most important factor
   - Required skills vs preferred skills weighted calculation

2. **Technical Tests** - **15%** (was 30%)  
   - Proportional to relevant tests passed
   - Job-specific technical skills verification

3. **Cognitive Tests** - **10%** (NEW)
   - Average of all cognitive tests taken
   - Includes: Numerical, Verbal, Logical, Abstract, Spatial, Diagrammatic, Situational Judgment

4. **Location Bonus** - **15%** (was 20%)
   - Geographic compatibility
   - Exact match gets 100%

5. **Content Similarity** - **15%** (NEW - now included)
   - How well profile matches job description
   - Text analysis between candidate profile and job posting

6. **Career Cluster Fit** - **5%** (NEW - now included)
   - Career path alignment
   - Industry and role progression fit

## New Formula:

```
Global Score = (Skills × 40%) + (Technical Tests × 15%) + (Cognitive Tests × 10%) + (Location × 15%) + (Content Similarity × 15%) + (Career Cluster Fit × 5%)
```

## Example for Your Case:

**Your Profile** (based on the match breakdown you showed):
- Skills: Let's say 50% match
- Technical Tests: 0% (no tests passed yet)
- Cognitive Tests: 0% (no cognitive tests taken yet) 
- Location: 100% (Casablanca match)
- Content Similarity: 19% (as shown in your breakdown)
- Career Cluster Fit: 26% (as shown in your breakdown)

**Calculation**:
(50 × 0.40) + (0 × 0.15) + (0 × 0.10) + (100 × 0.15) + (19 × 0.15) + (26 × 0.05)
= 20 + 0 + 0 + 15 + 2.85 + 1.3
= **39.15%**

This matches closer to your current 38% score!

## What You Can Do to Improve:

1. **Take Cognitive Tests** (+10% potential): Take numerical, verbal, logical reasoning tests
2. **Pass Technical Tests** (+15% potential): Retake and pass Java/relevant technical tests  
3. **Improve Skills Match** (current biggest factor at 40%)

## UI Display:

The "View Details" section should now show:
- ✅ Skills (40% weight)
- ✅ Technical Tests (15% weight) 
- ✅ **Cognitive Tests (10% weight)** - **NEW**
- ✅ Location Bonus (15% weight)
- ✅ Content Similarity (15% weight) - **NOW INCLUDED**
- ✅ Career Cluster Fit (5% weight) - **NOW INCLUDED**

The cognitive tests percentage will be displayed even if you haven't taken any tests yet (showing 0%).
