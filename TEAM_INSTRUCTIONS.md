Hey team! 👋 

Here's how to get started with our **JobGate Career Quest** project:

## 🚀 Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/G-Zak/jobgate-career-quest.git
cd jobgate-career-quest
```

### Step 2: Run Setup Script
```bash
./scripts/team-setup.sh
```

### Step 3: Verify Everything Works
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend: http://localhost:8000
- Try clicking "Start Game" to test the Phaser integration

## 📚 What to Read

1. **TEAM_QUICK_START.md** - Essential first steps
2. **TEAM_COLLABORATION_SETUP.md** - Complete workflow guide
3. **docs/BRANCHING_STRATEGY.md** - How we manage branches

## 🎯 Your First Task

Create a test branch to make sure everything works:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-name-setup-test
# Make a small change (add a comment with your name)
git add .
git commit -m "feat: team member setup verification"
git push -u origin feature/your-name-setup-test
# Then create a Pull Request on GitHub
```

## 🤝 Team Workflow Summary

- **Always work on feature branches** (never directly on main)
- **Push your work daily** so others can see progress
- **Use Pull Requests** for code review before merging
- **Ask questions** - better to ask than break something!

## 🆘 If Something Goes Wrong

1. Check the logs: `docker-compose logs frontend` or `docker-compose logs backend`
2. Restart containers: `docker-compose down && docker-compose up`
3. Ask for help in our team chat
4. Check the troubleshooting sections in the guides

## 📱 Communication

Let's establish our team communication:
- **Daily**: Share what you're working on
- **Blockers**: Report immediately if you're stuck
- **PRs**: Review each other's code
- **Questions**: Ask anytime!

## 🏗️ Project Structure

```
frontend/     # React + Phaser game (UI developer focus)
backend/      # Django API + database (backend developer focus)
devops/       # Docker, nginx (full-stack developer focus)
