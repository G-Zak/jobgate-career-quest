## About Dropgate & The Mission

Dropgate is an innovative technology company specializing in intelligent recruitment solutions. The company's mission is to revolutionize the hiring process by leveraging artificial intelligence and data-driven insights to create more accurate, efficient, and fair candidate assessments.

### Internship Overview

**Duration:** July – September 2025 (3 months)  
**Role:** Software Engineering Intern  
**Primary Mission:** Design and implement a comprehensive skills validation and intelligent recruitment platform that transforms how companies assess and match candidates with job opportunities.

### Project Significance

The JobGate platform addresses critical challenges in modern recruitment:
