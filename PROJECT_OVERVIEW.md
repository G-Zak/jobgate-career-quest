# JobGate - Career Assessment Platform

## Project Description

JobGate is a comprehensive career assessment and job matching platform that leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning to evaluate candidates' skills across multiple dimensions and provide intelligent job recommendations. The platform combines cognitive testing, technical assessments, and behavioral evaluations to create detailed employability profiles and match candidates with suitable career opportunities.

### Business Context
