# React Questions Fix - Skill-Test Linking

## 🐛 Problem Identified

When clicking on "React" skill, users were getting SQLite questions instead of React-specific questions. The skill-test linking was not working correctly.

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### Missing React Questions
- The `generateMockQuestions` function had questions for SQLite and JavaScript
- No React-specific questions were defined
- Skill matching was falling back to general questions

### Skill-Test Linking Issue
- Each skill needs its own dedicated question bank
- Questions must be properly linked to their respective skills
- Fallback mechanism should use skill-appropriate questions

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. Added Comprehensive React Questions (20 Questions)
Created a complete React question bank covering:

**Basic React Concepts:**
- What is React and its purpose
- JSX syntax and usage
- React components and their structure
- Virtual DOM concept

**React Hooks:**
- useState for state management
- useEffect for side effects
- useCallback for function memoization
- useMemo for value memoization
- useContext for context consumption

**Advanced React Features:**
- Props vs State differences
- Controlled vs Uncontrolled components
- React.memo for performance optimization
- React Context for global state
- Prop drilling and solutions

**React Ecosystem:**
- React Router for navigation
- React Fragments for grouping
- React Portals for rendering outside tree
- Error Boundaries for error handling
- React Suspense for loading states

### 2. Enhanced Skill Matching Logic
The `generateMockQuestions` function now properly matches:
- **SQLite** → SQLite-specific questions
- **JavaScript** → JavaScript-specific questions  
- **React** → React-specific questions
- **Django** → Django-specific questions
- **General** → General programming questions

### 3. Question Structure
Each React question includes:
- **Clear question text** - Professional, exam-quality questions
- **5 answer options** - Multiple choice format
- **Correct answer index** - 0-4 based on position
- **Detailed explanation** - Educational explanations for learning

## 🎯 Expected Results

After this fix:

1. **✅ Correct Skill-Test Linking** - React skill shows React questions
2. **✅ Professional Questions** - 20 high-quality React questions
3. **✅ Comprehensive Coverage** - All major React concepts covered
4. **✅ Consistent Experience** - Same quality for all skills
5. **✅ Educational Value** - Detailed explanations for learning

## 📁 Files Modified

- `frontend/src/features/skills-assessment/components/SkillBasedTests.jsx`
  - Added React question bank (lines 477-598)
  - Enhanced skill matching logic
  - Improved question variety and quality

## 🔄 Question Generation Flow (Fixed)

```
1. User clicks "Commencer le test" for React skill
   ↓
2. generateMockQuestions() called with React skill
   ↓
3. Function identifies skill as 'react'
   ↓
4. Selects React question bank (20 questions)
   ↓
5. Generates 20 unique React questions
   ↓
6. User gets React-specific test content
```

## 🎉 Status

**FIXED** - React skill now correctly shows React-specific questions instead of SQLite questions. All skills (SQLite, JavaScript, React) now have their own dedicated question banks.
