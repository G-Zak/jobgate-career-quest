# Section 1 Complete Image Setup Guide

## ✅ Component Updated!
The test component now supports your complete image format with:
- Full question image display (shows component shapes + all options)  
- Clickable letter buttons below (A, B, C, D, E)
- Proper answer tracking and scoring

## 📁 Where to Save Your Question Images

Save your complete question screenshots here:
```
/Users/zakariaguennani/Documents/Dev/EMSI/Internship/jobgate-career-quest/frontend/src/assets/images/spatial/questions/section_1/
```

## 🏷️ File Naming Convention

Save each question image as:
- `question_1.png` ← Your current image (with rectangle, triangles, options A-E)
- `question_2.png` ← Next question
- `question_3.png` ← Next question  
- ... (up to `question_40.png`)

## 🎯 Your Current Question Analysis

Looking at your attached image, this appears to be **Question 1**:
- **Component shapes**: Rectangle with 'b', Triangle with 'a', Triangle with 'b'
- **Task**: Join by corresponding letters  
- **Options**: A, B, C, D, E (different assemblies)
- **Correct answer**: You'll need to determine which option is correct

## 📝 What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Save Images
```bash
# Navigate to the questions folder
cd /Users/zakariaguennani/Documents/Dev/EMSI/Internship/jobgate-career-quest/frontend/src/assets/images/spatial/questions/section_1/

# Save your screenshots as:
# question_1.png (your current image)
# question_2.png
# question_3.png
# ... (up to question_40.png)
```

### Step 2: Set Correct Answers
Edit this file to set the correct answers:
`/Users/zakariaguennani/Documents/Dev/EMSI/Internship/jobgate-career-quest/frontend/src/features/skills-assessment/data/spatialTestSections.js`

Find each question and update the `correct_answer` field:
```javascript
{
  id: 1,
  // ... other fields
  correct_answer: "C", // ← Change this to the correct letter (A, B, C, D, or E)
},
```
