# Section 1 Questions - Complete Format Instructions

## Your Image Format
You have complete question pages that include:
- Component shapes at the top (rectangle with 'b', triangle with 'a', triangle with 'b')
- Multiple choice options below (A, B, C, D, E)
- All in one screenshot

## Option 1: Use Complete Images (Recommended for Quick Setup)

### Save complete question images as:
```
/frontend/src/assets/images/spatial/questions/section_1/question_1.png
/frontend/src/assets/images/spatial/questions/section_1/question_2.png
... (up to question_40.png)
```

### For this approach, I'll update the component to:
1. Show the complete question image
2. Display clickable option letters (A, B, C, D, E) below the image
3. Handle selection and scoring

## Option 2: Split Images (More Interactive)

If you prefer to split them:
1. **Question image**: Just the top part with component shapes
2. **Option images**: Individual A, B, C, D, E options

## Current Question Analysis
Looking at your image, this appears to be question 1 where:
- **Component shapes**: Rectangle (b), Triangle (a), Triangle (b)
- **Task**: Join by corresponding letters
- **Options**: A, B, C, D, E showing different assemblies

Which approach would you prefer? I recommend **Option 1** (complete images) since it's:
- ✅ Faster to implement
- ✅ Matches your book format exactly
- ✅ Less image processing needed
- ✅ Maintains visual consistency
