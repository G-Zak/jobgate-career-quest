## Test Flow After Image Addition

1. **Main Instructions** → User sees overall test overview
2. **Section 1 Intro** → Shows your instruction image + exact text from book
3. **Questions 1-40** → Individual shape assembly questions (you'll add these images later)
4. **Results** → Test completion and scoring

## Next Steps

1. Save the instruction image to the path above
2. The intro screen is ready to display it
3. Later, you can add individual question images (question_1.png through question_40.png)
4. Add corresponding option images (question_X_option_a/b/c/d.png)

The test structure now perfectly matches your book's Section 1 format!
