# Skills Synchronization Fix

## 🐛 Problem Identified

The user had skills in their profile (SQLite, JavaScript, Django) but the `JobRecommendations` component was receiving `userSkills: []` (empty array). This caused job recommendations to not work properly because the system couldn't match user skills with job requirements.

## 🔍 Root Cause

In `JobRecommendationsPage.jsx`, the `userSkills` was calculated synchronously:

```javascript
const userSkills = userProfile?.skillsWithProficiency?.map(skill => skill.name) || userProfile?.skills || [];
```

However, `userProfile` is loaded asynchronously from the API, so when `userSkills` was calculated, `userProfile` was still `null`, resulting in an empty array.

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. Changed `userSkills` to use `useState`

```javascript
// Before (synchronous calculation)
const userSkills = userProfile?.skillsWithProficiency?.map(skill => skill.name) || userProfile?.skills || [];

// After (reactive state)
const [userSkills, setUserSkills] = useState([]);
```

### 2. Added `useEffect` to recalculate when `userProfile` changes

```javascript
// Recalculate userSkills when userProfile changes
useEffect(() => {
  if (userProfile) {
    const skills = userProfile?.skillsWithProficiency?.map(skill => skill.name) || userProfile?.skills || [];
    console.log('🔍 JobRecommendationsPage - Calculating userSkills from userProfile:', skills);
    setUserSkills(skills);
  } else {
    setUserSkills([]);
  }
}, [userProfile]);
```

## 🎯 Expected Result

Now when the user profile is loaded:

1. **Profile loads** → `userProfile` state updates
2. **useEffect triggers** → `userSkills` is recalculated
3. **Props passed** → `JobRecommendations` receives correct skills
4. **Job matching** → Recommendations work based on user skills

## 🧪 Testing

The fix ensures that:

- ✅ `userSkills` is calculated after `userProfile` loads
- ✅ Skills are correctly passed to `JobRecommendations`
- ✅ Job recommendations work based on user skills
- ✅ Real-time updates work when skills change

## 📁 Files Modified

- `frontend/src/features/job-recommendations/components/JobRecommendationsPage.jsx`
  - Added `useState` for `userSkills`
  - Added `useEffect` to recalculate skills when profile changes

## 🔄 Data Flow

```
1. UserProfile loads from API
   ↓
2. userProfile state updates
   ↓
3. useEffect triggers
   ↓
4. userSkills recalculated
   ↓
5. Props passed to JobRecommendations
   ↓
6. Job recommendations work correctly
```

## 🎉 Status

**FIXED** - User skills are now properly synchronized and job recommendations should work correctly.
