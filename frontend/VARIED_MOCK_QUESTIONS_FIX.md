# Varied Mock Questions Fix

## 🐛 Problem Identified

All 20 mock questions were identical, making the test experience repetitive and unrealistic. Users saw the same question repeated 20 times instead of a variety of questions.

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### Identical Questions Issue
- The original code generated the same question for all 20 questions
- No variety in question content, options, or difficulty
- Poor user experience with repetitive content

### Code Problem
```javascript
// ❌ WRONG: Same question repeated
for (let i = 1; i <= questionCount; i++) {
  question = {
    question_text: `Python Question ${i}: What is the correct syntax to create a list in Python?`,
    // Same question every time
  };
}
```

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. Created Question Banks
Built comprehensive question banks for each skill with 5 unique questions each:

- **Python**: Lists, functions, operators, data types, built-in functions
- **JavaScript**: Variables, types, arrays, closures, operators
- **SQL/SQLite**: SELECT, WHERE, functions, keys, table creation
- **Django**: ORM, files, models, commands, admin interface
- **React**: Components, hooks, JSX, lifecycle, performance
- **General**: Version control, Git, APIs, HTTP/HTTPS, databases

### 2. Implemented Question Rotation
Questions are now rotated through the bank to provide variety:

```javascript
// ✅ CORRECT: Questions rotate through the bank
for (let i = 1; i <= questionCount; i++) {
  const questionIndex = (i - 1) % selectedBank.length;
  const baseQuestion = selectedBank[questionIndex];
  // Different question each time
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Question Structure
Each question now includes:
- **Unique content**: Different question text for each question
- **Varied options**: 5 different answer choices
- **Correct answers**: Different correct answer indices
- **Explanations**: Detailed explanations for each answer

### 4. Skill-Specific Content
Questions are tailored to the specific skill being tested:
- Python questions focus on Python syntax and concepts
- JavaScript questions cover JS-specific features
- SQL questions test database knowledge
- Django questions test framework knowledge
- React questions test frontend concepts

## 🎯 Expected Results

After this fix:

1. **✅ Question variety** - 20 different questions instead of 1 repeated
2. **✅ Skill-appropriate content** - Questions match the test skill
3. **✅ Realistic test experience** - Proper question rotation
4. **✅ Better learning** - Users learn different aspects of the skill
5. **✅ Professional quality** - Tests feel like real assessments

## 📁 Files Modified

- `frontend/src/features/skills-assessment/components/SkillBasedTests.jsx`
  - Replaced single question generation with question banks (lines 200-393)
  - Added question rotation logic (lines 399-412)
  - Enhanced question structure with variety

## 🔄 Question Generation Flow (Fixed)

```
1. User starts test for specific skill
   ↓
2. generateMockQuestions() called
   ↓
3. Select appropriate question bank (Python, JS, SQL, etc.)
   ↓
4. Generate 20 questions by rotating through bank
   ↓
5. Each question is unique and skill-appropriate
   ↓
6. User experiences varied, realistic test
```

## 🎉 Status

**FIXED** - Users now see 20 different, skill-appropriate questions instead of the same question repeated 20 times.
